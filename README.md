# Capstone Project for Business Intelligence Engineer

This is a Business Intelligence dashboard project which provides visibility to the Marketing & Sales Department for monitoring product sales, branch performance, and achievement of sales targets regularly (daily, monthly, quarterly, and yearly). This project is expected to replace the manual report consolidation process carried out by the Marketing & Sales Department and become a dashboard that can be accessed by all branch managers in charge of Superstores to monitor and evaluate the performance of their stores
